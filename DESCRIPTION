Description: This data package contains data in raw .iDAT form from several samples run on the Illumina 450k methylation platform.  The titration samples were prepared by treating a "methylated" standard pool of commercially purchased sperm samples with m.SssI, three times, and mock-treating an "unmethylated" standard pool with vehicle, three times.  Then the samples were titrated to 20%, 35%, 60%, and 85% "methylated" (m.SssI-treated).  Three samples from peripheral blood lymphocytes are also included.
